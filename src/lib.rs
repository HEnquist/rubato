//! An audio sample rate conversion library for Rust.
//!
//! This library provides resamplers to process audio in chunks.
//! The ratio between input and output sample rates is completely free.
//! Implementations are available that accept a fixed length input
//! while returning a variable length output, and vice versa.
//! The resampling is based on band-limited interpolation using sinc
//! interpolation filters. The sinc interpolation upsamples by an adjustable factor,
//! and then the new sample points are calculated by interpolating between these points.
//!
//! ## Documentation
//!
//! The full documentation can be generated by rustdoc. To generate and view it run:
//! ```text
//! cargo doc --open
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example
//! Resample a single chunk of a dummy audio file from 44100 to 48000 Hz.
//! See also the "fixedin64" example that can be used to process a file from disk.
//! ```
//! use rubato::{Resampler, SincFixedIn, Interpolation};
//! let mut resampler = SincFixedIn::<f64>::new(
//!     48000 as f32 / 44100 as f32,
//!     256,
//!     0.95,
//!     160,
//!     Interpolation::Nearest,
//!     1024,
//!     2,
//! );
//!
//! let waves_in = vec![vec![0.0f64; 1024];2];
//! let waves_out = resampler.process(&waves_in).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//!
//! The `rubato` crate only depends on the `num` crate and should work with any rustc version that crate supports.
